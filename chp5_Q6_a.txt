// Q3.a. What do you understand by JUMP statements?

    1. Definition

    Jump statements are special, reserved keywords which are used to modify
    the behavior of conditional and iterative statements. They achieve this
    by allowing you to abrubtly, exit a loop, jump to the next iteration in
    a loop, or literally, transfer the program control to another particular
    part of a program. 

    2. Types of JUMP statements.

      `GOTO` statement

    The goto statement allows you to transfer control to a labeled section
    within a program. It's rarely used because it can make code harder to
    read and maintain, or cause errors that are hard to detect... but it's
    useful in certain situations like breaking out of deeply nested loops.

      `BREAK` statement

    The break statement is used to exit from a loop or switch statement. When
    a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop terminates
    completely, and execution proceeds the next statements following the loop.

      `CONTINUE` statement

    The continue statement skips the remaining code inside a loop for an 
    ongoing iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop. It
    can be used within for, while, and do-while loops.

      `RETURN` statement

    The return statement is used to terminate the execution of a function and
    return control back to the calling function. It also returns a value to the
    calling function.
